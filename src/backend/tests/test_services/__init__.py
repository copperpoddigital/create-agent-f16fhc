"""
Test package for service components of the Freight Price Movement Agent.

This package contains unit tests for backend service components, with a focus on:
- Data Ingestion Service tests
- Analysis Engine tests 
- Presentation Service tests
- Integration Service tests

Test modules in this package verify the correct functioning of individual service 
components in isolation, particularly the critical calculation functions in the 
Analysis Engine that form the core functionality of the application.
"""

# This file can be extended in the future to include common test utilities,
# fixtures, or configuration shared across multiple service test modules.
