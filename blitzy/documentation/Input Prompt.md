**Freight Price Movement Agent – Requirement Document (Crisp Version)**

----------

### 1. Purpose

Develop an automated agent that calculates changes (movements) in freight charges over a specified time period. The agent must deliver accurate, timely insights into cost fluctuations to support decision-making in logistics and supply chain management.

----------

### 2. Core Requirements

1. **Data Collection & Ingestion**

   - **Supported Data Sources:**

     - Historical freight cost data (e.g., CSV files, internal database, or via API).

   - **Data Fields:**

     - Freight charge amount, currency, origin, destination, date/time of quote, and any relevant surcharges.

   - **Data Quality Checks:**

     - Validate completeness, correct formatting, and remove/flag anomalous data (e.g., zero or negative prices).

2. **Time Period Selection**

   - **User-Defined Range:**

     - Start date/time and end date/time for analysis.

   - **Granularity:**

     - Daily, weekly, monthly, or a custom interval.

3. **Price Movement Calculation**

   - **Change Metrics:**

     - Absolute change (difference in freight charges between two points in time).

     - Percentage change.

     - Trend direction (up, down, stable).

   - **Aggregation Options:**

     - Average, min, and max freight charges over the selected interval.

   - **Historical Comparison (Optional):**

     - Compare current charges to baseline (e.g., same period last year).

4. **Result Presentation**

   - **Output Format:**

     - Numeric results (JSON, CSV, or text summary).

     - Trend indicators (e.g., “+5% vs. previous period”).

   - **Visualization (Optional):**

     - Simple time-series chart or bar chart for selected interval.

5. **Performance & Scalability**

   - **Response Time:**

     - Must handle queries on large datasets within acceptable time (e.g., seconds for a 1M-row dataset).

   - **Scalability:**

     - Architecture should accommodate increased data volume without severe performance degradation.

6. **Security & Data Privacy**

   - **Data Access Controls:**

     - Restrict data retrieval to authorized users only.

   - **Encryption:**

     - In-transit and at-rest encryption for sensitive data (if required by regulations).

7. **Error Handling**

   - **Graceful Degradation:**

     - Provide meaningful error messages when data is incomplete or analysis cannot be performed.

   - **Logging & Alerts:**

     - Log failed operations and alert administrators when critical issues occur (optional).

----------

### 3. Dependencies & Assumptions

- **Data Availability:** Assumes consistent and reliable freight cost data from trusted sources.

- **Infrastructure:** A stable environment (e.g., cloud platform, on-premise server) with adequate resources.

- **Integration:** May integrate with existing systems (ERP, TMS) via APIs or direct database connections.

----------

### 4. Acceptance Criteria

1. **Accurate Calculations:**

   - The agent must return correct freight charge movements (difference and percentage change) for a given time period.

2. **Timely Response:**

   - Analysis must be completed within a reasonable time threshold (defined by project stakeholders).

3. **User-Friendly Outputs:**

   - Clear, unambiguous metrics and optional visual representation.

4. **Data Integrity:**

   - Handled erroneous or missing data gracefully, with logs and alerts where necessary.

----------

### 5. Milestones

1. **Data Ingestion & Validation Module** – Completed and tested.

2. **Analysis Engine** – Implements calculations for absolute/percentage changes.

3. **Output Generation** – Formatting of results, including optional charts.

4. **Testing & Optimization** – Load testing, performance tuning, and final acceptance tests.
