### Security Principles

The security architecture is built on the following core principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls to protect against various threats
2. **Least Privilege**: Users and components have only the permissions necessary to perform their functions
3. **Secure by Default**: Security is built into the system from the ground up, not added as an afterthought
4. **Zero Trust**: All requests are authenticated and authorized, regardless of source
5. **Privacy by Design**: Data protection measures are integrated into the system architecture
6. **Continuous Monitoring**: Security events are continuously monitored and analyzed
7. **Fail Secure**: System fails in a secure state when errors occur

### Security Standards Compliance

The Freight Price Movement Agent security architecture is designed to comply with the following standards and frameworks:

1. **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common web application vulnerabilities
2. **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect**: Industry standard for authentication and authorization
3. **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk management and security best practices
4. **SOC 2**: Controls for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy
5. **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy requirements (where applicable)

## Authentication Framework

The Freight Price Movement Agent implements a robust authentication framework based on OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standards. This framework provides secure user authentication, token management, and session handling.

### Authentication Methods

The system supports multiple authentication methods to accommodate different use cases:

1. **Username/Password**: Standard user login with secure password policies
2. **OAuth 2.0 / OIDC**: Support for enterprise identity providers
3. **API Keys**: Long-lived tokens for system-to-system integration
4. **JWT Tokens**: Short-lived tokens for API authentication

    Client->>AuthServer: Request with Refresh Token
    AuthServer->>Client: New Access Token
    Client->>API: Request with New Access Token
    API->>Client: Protected Resource
```

### Token Management

The system implements a comprehensive token management strategy:

1. **Access Tokens**: Short-lived JWT tokens (15 minutes) for API authentication
2. **Refresh Tokens**: Longer-lived tokens (24 hours) for obtaining new access tokens
3. **Token Storage**: Secure storage with HTTP-only cookies for refresh tokens
4. **Token Validation**: Signature verification, expiration checking, and type validation
5. **Token Revocation**: Ability to revoke tokens before expiration

Tokens are generated using industry-standard cryptographic algorithms (HMAC-SHA256) and include claims for user identity, permissions, expiration time, and token type.

### Session Management

User sessions are managed securely to prevent unauthorized access:

1. **Session Creation**: Sessions are created upon successful authentication
2. **Session Identification**: Unique session IDs generated using cryptographically secure methods
3. **Session Storage**: Server-side session storage with client-side reference
4. **Session Expiration**: Automatic expiration after 30 minutes of inactivity
5. **Session Termination**: Explicit logout or timeout
6. **Concurrent Sessions**: Support for multiple active sessions with visibility and control

### Password Policies

The system enforces strong password policies to prevent unauthorized access:

1. **Complexity Requirements**: Minimum 12 characters with mixed case, numbers, and symbols
2. **Password Storage**: Secure hashing using bcrypt with appropriate work factor
3. **Password Expiration**: 90-day password rotation policy
4. **Password History**: Prevention of password reuse (last 10 passwords)
5. **Failed Attempts**: Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
6. **Password Reset**: Secure password reset process with time-limited tokens

### Multi-Factor Authentication

The system supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) for additional security:

1. **Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP)**: Compatible with standard authenticator apps
2. **Email Verification**: One-time codes sent via email
3. **SMS Verification**: One-time codes sent via SMS (where available)
4. **MFA Enforcement**: Configurable MFA requirements based on user role and risk level

## Authorization System

The Freight Price Movement Agent implements a comprehensive authorization system to control access to resources and functionality. The system uses role-based access control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions.

### Role-Based Access Control

Access control is implemented using a role-based approach:

1. **User Roles**: Predefined roles with associated permissions
   - Viewer: Read-only access to reports and analyses
   - Analyst: Create and run analyses
   - Data Manager: Manage data sources and imports
   - Administrator: Full system access

2. **Role Assignment**: Users are assigned one or more roles
3. **Role Hierarchy**: Roles can inherit permissions from other roles
4. **Default Role**: New users are assigned a default role with minimal permissions

    P1 --> E[Access Decision]
```

### Permission Management

Permissions are managed at a granular level:

1. **Resource Types**: Data sources, analyses, reports, system settings
2. **Operations**: Read, create, update, delete, execute
3. **Permission Assignment**: Permissions are assigned to roles
4. **Permission Checking**: All operations check for required permissions

| Permission | Viewer | Analyst | Data Manager | Administrator |
|------------|--------|---------|--------------|---------------|
| View Analysis | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Create Analysis | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Manage Data Sources | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Configure System | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |

### Data Access Control

Access to data is controlled at multiple levels:

1. **Row-Level Security**: Users can only access authorized data rows
2. **Column-Level Security**: Sensitive columns can be restricted based on user role
3. **Data Filters**: Automatic application of data filters based on user context
4. **Data Ownership**: Users have full access to data they create
5. **Data Sharing**: Explicit sharing of data with other users or groups
