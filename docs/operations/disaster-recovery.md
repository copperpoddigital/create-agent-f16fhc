# Freight Price Movement Agent - Disaster Recovery Plan

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

This document outlines the comprehensive disaster recovery strategy for the Freight Price Movement Agent system. It defines the procedures, responsibilities, and technical configurations necessary to recover from various disaster scenarios, ranging from individual component failures to complete system outages.

The disaster recovery plan covers:
- All production environments of the Freight Price Movement Agent
- Critical data components including freight pricing information
- Application services and infrastructure components
- Integration points with external systems
- Recovery procedures, testing methodologies, and validation processes

This plan does not cover:
- Development or testing environments
- Non-critical ancillary systems
- Business continuity planning beyond technical recovery

### 1.2 Recovery Objectives

The Freight Price Movement Agent has established the following recovery objectives:

| Recovery Aspect | Target | Implementation |
|-----------------|--------|----------------|
| Recovery Point Objective (RPO) | < 15 minutes | Continuous backup with point-in-time recovery |
| Recovery Time Objective (RTO) | < 4 hours | Automated recovery procedures with regular testing |
| Minimum Business Continuity | Read-only access to recent data | Replicated read-only database |

These objectives are designed to minimize both data loss and system downtime while balancing technical feasibility and cost considerations.

### 1.3 Disaster Classification

Disasters are classified into the following categories based on severity and impact:

| Level | Classification | Description | Examples | Recovery Lead |
|-------|---------------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 1 | Minor Incident | Single component failure with minimal impact | Application service crash, temporary API timeout | Service Engineer |
| 2 | Service Disruption | Multiple component failures or service degradation | Database performance issues, elevated error rates | Operations Lead |
| 3 | Major Outage | Critical service unavailability | Primary database failure, availability zone outage | DR Team Lead |
| 4 | Complete Failure | Total system unavailability | Region-wide AWS outage, catastrophic data corruption | CTO + DR Team |

## 2. Disaster Recovery Architecture

### 2.1 Multi-Region Deployment

The Freight Price Movement Agent employs a multi-region architecture to ensure high availability and disaster recovery capabilities:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Region 1 - Primary (us-east-1)"
        A1[Availability Zone 1]
        A2[Availability Zone 2]
        A3[Availability Zone 3]
        
        A1 --- B1[Application Cluster]
        A2 --- B2[Application Cluster]
        A3 --- B3[Application Cluster]
        
        B1 --- C1[Database Primary]
        B2 --- C2[Database Replica]
        B3 --- C3[Database Replica]
        
        D1[Load Balancer]
        D1 --> B1
        D1 --> B2
        D1 --> B3
    end
    
    subgraph "Region 2 - DR (us-west-2)"
        E1[Availability Zone 1]
        E2[Availability Zone 2]
        
        E1 --- F1[Application Cluster - Standby]
        E2 --- F2[Application Cluster - Standby]
        
        F1 --- G1[Database Replica]
        F2 --- G2[Database Replica]
        
        H1[Load Balancer - Standby]
        H1 --> F1
        H1 --> F2
    end
    
    C1 -.->|Cross-Region Replication| G1
    I[Route 53] --> D1
    I -.->|Failover| H1
```

The multi-region architecture includes:
- Primary production region (us-east-1) with three availability zones
- Disaster recovery region (us-west-2) with two availability zones
- Automated replication between regions
- DNS-based failover capability via Route 53

### 2.2 Data Redundancy Strategy

Data redundancy is implemented through multiple layers to ensure resilience against various failure scenarios:

| Data Type | Primary Redundancy | Cross-Region Redundancy | Recovery Mechanism |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Operational Data | Multi-AZ database with synchronous replication | Asynchronous cross-region replication | Automatic failover within region, manual promotion across regions |
| Application State | Stateless design with persistent storage | Cross-region replication of persistent data | No special recovery needed due to stateless design |
| Object Storage | S3 with cross-region replication | Versioning and replication to DR region | Automatic with S3 durability guarantees |
| Configuration | Version-controlled IaC | Deployed to both regions | Re-application of infrastructure templates |

### 2.3 Backup Infrastructure

The backup infrastructure provides multiple recovery options with varying granularity and retention periods:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Primary Database] -->|Continuous WAL Archiving| B[WAL Archive Storage]
    A -->|Daily Full Backup| C[Daily Backup Storage]
    A -->|Weekly Full Backup| D[Weekly Backup Storage]
    A -->|Monthly Full Backup| E[Monthly Backup Storage]
    
    B -->|Point-in-Time Recovery| F[Recovery Process]
    C -->|Recent Recovery| F
    D -->|Medium-term Recovery| F
    E -->|Long-term Recovery| F
    
    F --> G[Restored Database]
    
    H[S3 Data] -->|Versioning| I[Version History]
    H -->|Cross-Region Replication| J[DR Region S3]
    
    K[Infrastructure as Code] -->|Version Control| L[Git Repository]
    L -->|Deployment| M[CloudFormation/Terraform State]
```

Key components of the backup infrastructure include:
- Continuous Write-Ahead Log (WAL) archiving for point-in-time recovery
- Scheduled full backups at daily, weekly, and monthly intervals
- S3 versioning and replication for object storage durability
- Version-controlled infrastructure as code for configuration recovery

## 3. Backup Procedures

### 3.1 Backup Types and Schedule

The Freight Price Movement Agent implements a comprehensive backup strategy with the following components:

| Backup Type | Frequency | Retention | Storage Location | Encryption |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|------------------|------------|
| Database - WAL Archiving | Continuous | 7 days | S3 + Glacier | AES-256 |
| Database - Full Snapshot | Daily | 35 days | RDS Automated Backups | AES-256 |
| Database - Full Snapshot | Weekly | 3 months | S3 + Glacier | AES-256 |
| Database - Full Snapshot | Monthly | 7 years | S3 + Glacier | AES-256 |
| Application Data | Daily | 90 days | S3 Cross-Region | AES-256 |
| Configuration | On change | Indefinite | Git + S3 | AES-256 |

All backups are automated using AWS native services or scheduled scripts, with monitoring to ensure successful completion.

### 3.2 Backup Verification

Backup verification is a critical component of ensuring recoverability:

1. **Automated Verification**: 
   - All backups undergo automated integrity checks upon completion
   - SHA-256 checksums are computed and stored with the backup
   - Backup logs are monitored for completion status

2. **Scheduled Restoration Tests**:
   - Monthly: Database restore test to isolated environment
   - Quarterly: Full application restore test in isolated environment
   - Results documented in the DR testing log

3. **Verification Procedures**:
   - Database backups: Restore to test instance, verify schema and query functionality
   - Application backups: Restore to test environment, verify basic functionality
   - Configuration: Deploy to test environment, verify infrastructure creation

### 3.3 Backup Retention Policy

Retention policies balance regulatory requirements, business needs, and storage costs:

| Data Type | Active Retention | Archive Retention | Purge Policy |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Freight Data | 1 year in primary storage | 7 years in archive storage | Automated purge after retention period |
| Analysis Results | 90 days in primary storage | 1 year in archive storage | Automated purge after retention period |
| System Logs | 30 days in CloudWatch | 90 days in S3 | Automated purge after retention period |
| Audit Logs | 90 days in primary storage | 7 years in archive storage | Automated purge after retention period |

Retention policies are enforced through:
- Automated lifecycle policies on S3 storage
- RDS automated backup retention settings
- Custom scripts for specialized retention requirements
- Regular compliance audits to verify retention policy implementation

## 7. Service Degradation Policies

### 7.1 Degradation Levels

The system can operate in various degraded states to maintain critical functionality:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Normal
    
    Normal --> Minor: Non-critical failure
    Minor --> Normal: Service restored
    Minor --> Moderate: Additional failures
    
    Moderate --> Minor: Service restored
    Moderate --> Severe: Critical service affected
    
    Severe --> Moderate: Critical service restored
    Severe --> Critical: Multiple critical failures
    
    Critical --> Severe: Critical service restored
    Critical --> [*]: Complete system restart
    
    state Normal {
        [*] --> FullOperation
    }
    
    state Minor {
        [*] --> ReducedFunctionality
    }
    
    state Moderate {
        [*] --> EssentialFeaturesOnly
    }
    
    state Severe {
        [*] --> CachedContentOnly
    }
    
    state Critical {
        [*] --> MaintenanceMode
    }
```

| Degradation Level | Trigger | Response | User Impact |
|-------------------|---------|----------|-------------|
| Minor | Non-critical service unavailable | Continue with reduced functionality | Limited feature availability |
| Moderate | Multiple non-critical services down | Disable non-essential features | Multiple features unavailable |
| Severe | Critical service degraded | Serve cached/static content only | Read-only mode, limited data currency |
| Critical | Multiple critical services down | Maintenance mode with status updates | System unavailable with status updates |

### 7.2 Feature Prioritization

During degraded operation, features are prioritized as follows:

| Priority | Feature Category | Examples |
|----------|------------------|----------|
| Critical | Core data access | Viewing existing freight data and analysis results |
| High | Basic analysis | Viewing pre-calculated price movements |
| Medium | New analysis | Creating new price movement analyses |
| Low | Reporting | Generating and exporting reports |
| Lowest | Administrative | User management, configuration updates |

Deployment Configuration:
- Feature flags control feature availability during degradation
- Configuration parameters in AWS Parameter Store define degradation levels
- Automated scaling policies adjust resource allocation to prioritized services

### 7.3 User Communication

Communication to users during service degradation follows these guidelines:

| Degradation Level | Communication Method | Message Content | Frequency |
|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Minor | In-app notification | Affected feature, estimated resolution | Once on feature access |
| Moderate | Banner notification | List of unavailable features, estimated resolution | Persistent with updates every 2 hours |
| Severe | Email + banner notification | System limitations, alternative access methods, estimated resolution | Immediate notification, updates every hour |
| Critical | Email + SMS + status page | System unavailability, estimated resolution time, alternative processes | Immediate notification, updates every 30 minutes |

Example Message Templates:

- **Minor**: "The report export feature is currently unavailable. Our team is working to restore functionality by [TIME]. Please try again later."

- **Moderate**: "Several features are temporarily unavailable due to system maintenance, including [FEATURE LIST]. Critical data access remains available. We expect to restore full functionality by [TIME]."

- **Severe**: "The Freight Price Movement Agent is currently operating in read-only mode. You can view existing data, but new analyses cannot be created at this time. Our technical team is actively working to restore full service by [TIME]."

- **Critical**: "The Freight Price Movement Agent is temporarily unavailable due to a technical issue. Our team is working urgently to restore service. We expect to resolve this issue by [TIME]. For urgent assistance, please contact your account representative."

    C --> D[Conduct Post-Mortem Meeting]
    D --> E[Document Findings]
    E --> F[Identify Action Items]
    F --> G[Assign Responsibilities]
    G --> H[Track Implementation]
    H --> I[Verify Effectiveness]
    I --> J[Update Runbooks]
    J --> K[Share Learnings]
```

The post-mortem should follow a blameless approach focused on system improvement:

1. **Timeline reconstruction**: 
   - Document what happened and when

2. Create Implementation Plan:
   a. Define specific tasks for each improvement
   b. Assign resources and set deadlines
   c. Establish success criteria for verification
   
3. Track Implementation:
   a. Regular status updates in team meetings
   b. Documentation of completed improvements
   c. Verification testing for critical changes
   
4. Validate Effectiveness:
   a. Conduct targeted DR tests for implemented improvements
   b. Verify metrics show expected improvement
   c. Collect feedback from team members
```

Implementation tracking should use the standard project management tools with dedicated tags for disaster recovery improvements.

### Appendix C: System Dependencies

#### C.1 Critical Dependencies

| System | Dependency Type | Impact if Unavailable | Workaround |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|------------|
| AWS RDS | Database | Complete system failure | None - critical dependency |
| AWS S3 | Object storage | Cannot process new data files | Temporarily store files locally |
| AWS ECS | Container orchestration | Cannot deploy new services | Manually run containers on EC2 |
| Route 53 | DNS | Difficulty accessing system | Direct IP access for emergency management |
| TMS API | External integration | Cannot ingest TMS data | Use CSV import as alternative |
| ERP API | External integration | Cannot ingest ERP data | Use CSV import as alternative |

#### C.2 Dependency Recovery Order

The correct order of dependency recovery is crucial for system restoration:

1. Networking infrastructure (VPC, subnets, security groups)
2. Database services (RDS)
3. Object storage (S3)
4. Caching services (ElastiCache)
5. Container orchestration (ECS)
6. Load balancing (ALB/NLB)
7. Application services
8. External integrations

This order ensures that core infrastructure is available before dependent services are started, minimizing failed dependencies during recovery.
