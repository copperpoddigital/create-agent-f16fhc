## Introduction

### Purpose and Scope

This document describes the comprehensive monitoring and observability strategy for the Freight Price Movement Agent system. It provides technical details on how the system's health, performance, and behavior are monitored, and outlines procedures for detecting, investigating, and resolving operational issues.

The monitoring system has been designed to provide visibility across all components of the Freight Price Movement Agent, from infrastructure to application layers, enabling both proactive and reactive operational support.

### Monitoring Objectives

The primary objectives of our monitoring strategy are:

1. **Reliability Monitoring** - Detect service disruptions and failures quickly to minimize downtime
2. **Performance Monitoring** - Track system performance against SLAs and identify optimization opportunities
3. **Capacity Planning** - Collect data to predict resource needs and inform scaling decisions
4. **Security and Compliance** - Monitor for unusual patterns that may indicate security issues
5. **Business Intelligence** - Gather operational metrics that provide insights into system usage and business impact

### Monitoring Layers

The monitoring system implements a multi-layered approach to ensure comprehensive visibility:

    subgraph "Monitoring Layers"
        A[Infrastructure Monitoring] --> B[Application Monitoring]
        B --> C[Business Metrics]
        C --> D[User Experience]
    end
    
    subgraph "Infrastructure Monitoring"
        A1[CPU/Memory/Disk]
        A2[Network]
        A3[Container Health]
    end
    
    subgraph "Application Monitoring"
        B1[Service Health]
        B2[API Performance]
        B3[Database Performance]
        B4[Error Rates]
    end
    
    subgraph "Business Metrics"
        C1[Analysis Volume]
        C2[Data Processing Rates]
        C3[User Activity]
    end
    
    subgraph "User Experience"
        D1[Response Times]
        D2[Error Rates]
        D3[Feature Usage]
    end
```

1. **Infrastructure Layer** - Monitors the underlying resources (CPU, memory, disk, network) that support the application
2. **Application Layer** - Tracks service health, performance, and behavior at the application level
3. **Business Layer** - Measures business-specific metrics such as analysis volume and data processing rates
4. **User Experience Layer** - Monitors the system from the user's perspective, tracking response times and error rates

## Monitoring Architecture

### Component Overview

The monitoring and observability infrastructure consists of the following core components:

| Component | Version | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Prometheus | 2.37.x | Metrics collection and storage |
| Grafana | 9.1.x | Metrics visualization and dashboards |
| Elasticsearch | 7.17.x | Log storage and analysis |
| Kibana | 7.17.x | Log visualization and exploration |
| Filebeat | 7.17.x | Log collection and shipping |
| Jaeger | 1.37.x | Distributed tracing collection and visualization |
| AlertManager | 0.24.x | Alert management and notification routing |
| Node Exporter | 1.3.x | Host-level metrics collection |

Additional components:

- Custom exporters for application-specific metrics
- Database exporters for PostgreSQL and Redis metrics
- Custom instrumentation libraries for tracing and metrics

### Deployment Architecture

The monitoring infrastructure is deployed alongside the main application components but isolated to ensure it doesn't impact production performance:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Freight Price Movement Agent System"
        A1[Data Ingestion Service]
        A2[Analysis Engine]
        A3[Presentation Service]
        A4[Integration Service]
        A5[Database]
        A6[Cache]
    end
    
    subgraph "Monitoring Infrastructure"
        B1[Prometheus]
        B2[Grafana]
        B3[Elasticsearch]
        B4[Kibana]
        B5[Jaeger]
        B6[AlertManager]
    end
    
    A1 -->|Metrics| B1
    A2 -->|Metrics| B1
    A3 -->|Metrics| B1
    A4 -->|Metrics| B1
    A5 -->|Metrics| B1
    A6 -->|Metrics| B1
    
    A1 -->|Logs| B3
    A2 -->|Logs| B3
    A3 -->|Logs| B3
    A4 -->|Logs| B3
    A5 -->|Logs| B3
    A6 -->|Logs| B3
    
    A1 -->|Traces| B5
    A2 -->|Traces| B5
    A3 -->|Traces| B5
    A4 -->|Traces| B5
    
    B1 -->|Alerts| B6
    B1 -->|Metrics| B2
    B3 -->|Logs| B4
```

The architecture is designed to:

- Scale independently from the main application
- Have minimal performance impact on production systems
- Provide high availability for monitoring components
- Support self-monitoring (monitoring systems monitor themselves)

### Data Flow

The monitoring data flows through the system as follows:

1. **Metrics Flow**:
   - Application components expose metrics endpoints (/metrics)
   - Prometheus scrapes these endpoints at regular intervals (15s default)
   - Metrics are stored in Prometheus's time-series database
   - Grafana queries Prometheus for visualization and dashboard display
   - AlertManager processes alerts based on metric thresholds

2. **Logs Flow**:
   - Application components write structured logs to files or stdout
   - Filebeat collects these logs and forwards them to Elasticsearch
   - Elasticsearch indexes and stores the log data
   - Kibana provides a UI for log searching, visualization, and analysis

3. **Traces Flow**:
   - Application components are instrumented with OpenTelemetry
   - Trace spans are sent to the Jaeger collector
   - Jaeger processes and stores the trace data
   - Jaeger UI provides trace visualization and analysis

### Security Considerations

The monitoring infrastructure implements several security measures:

1. **Network Isolation**:
   - Monitoring components are placed in a separate network segment
   - Access to monitoring UIs is restricted to authenticated users
   - Monitoring endpoints require authentication

2. **Data Protection**:
   - All monitoring traffic uses TLS encryption
   - Sensitive data is redacted from logs before storage
   - Monitoring data access is audited

3. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Role-based access control for all monitoring UIs
   - Service accounts with limited permissions for metrics collection
   - API tokens with regular rotation

4. **Compliance**:
   - Retention policies aligned with data governance requirements
   - Audit trails for all monitoring system access
   - Regular security scans of monitoring infrastructure

## Metrics Collection

### Infrastructure Metrics

Infrastructure metrics provide visibility into the underlying resources supporting the application. The following metrics are collected:

| Metric Category | Key Metrics | Collection Method | Normal Range |
|-----------------|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| CPU | Usage percentage, load average, throttling | Node Exporter | <70% |
| Memory | Usage percentage, available memory, swap usage | Node Exporter | <80% |
| Disk | Usage percentage, IOPS, latency | Node Exporter | <85% usage, <10ms latency |
| Network | Throughput, error rate, connection count | Node Exporter | <70% bandwidth, <0.1% error rate |
| Container | CPU/memory usage, restart count | cAdvisor | Varies by service |
| Host | Uptime, process count, file descriptors | Node Exporter | N/A |

Example PromQL queries for infrastructure monitoring:

```
# CPU usage per instance
100 - (avg by (instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])) * 100)

# Memory usage per instance
(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes) / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes * 100

# Disk usage per instance and mount point
100 - ((node_filesystem_avail_bytes * 100) / node_filesystem_size_bytes)

# Network traffic per interface
rate(node_network_transmit_bytes_total[5m])
rate(node_network_receive_bytes_total[5m])
```

### Application Metrics

Application metrics track the health and performance of each service in the Freight Price Movement Agent system:

| Metric Category | Key Metrics | Collection Method | Normal Range |
|-----------------|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| HTTP Requests | Request count, error rate, duration | Custom instrumentation | <1% error rate, <5s duration |
| Database | Query count, error rate, duration | PostgreSQL exporter | <100ms average query time |
| Cache | Hit rate, miss rate, eviction rate | Redis exporter | >80% hit rate |
| Message Queue | Queue depth, processing rate, age | Custom instrumentation | <10 messages in queue |
| Service Health | Uptime, readiness, liveness | Health check endpoints | 100% availability |
| Custom Business | Data ingestion rate, analysis count | Custom instrumentation | Varies |

Example application metrics in Prometheus format:

```
# HTTP request metrics
http_requests_total{method="GET", endpoint="/api/analysis", status="200"} 45823
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{method="GET", endpoint="/api/analysis", le="0.1"} 32145
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{method="GET", endpoint="/api/analysis", le="0.5"} 43215
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{method="GET", endpoint="/api/analysis", le="1.0"} 44912
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{method="GET", endpoint="/api/analysis", le="5.0"} 45823
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{method="GET", endpoint="/api/analysis", le="+Inf"} 45823

# Database metrics
database_query_duration_seconds_bucket{query="freight_data_select", le="0.01"} 23456
database_query_duration_seconds_bucket{query="freight_data_select", le="0.05"} 34567
database_query_duration_seconds_bucket{query="freight_data_select", le="0.1"} 38910
database_query_duration_seconds_bucket{query="freight_data_select", le="0.5"} 39234
database_query_duration_seconds_bucket{query="freight_data_select", le="+Inf"} 39234

# Cache metrics
cache_hits_total{cache="analysis_results"} 234567
cache_misses_total{cache="analysis_results"} 34567
```

### Database Metrics

Database-specific metrics are collected to monitor the health and performance of the PostgreSQL database and TimescaleDB extension:

| Metric Category | Key Metrics | Collection Method | Normal Range |
|-----------------|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Connection Pool | Active connections, idle connections, max connections | PostgreSQL exporter | <80% connection pool usage |
| Query Performance | Query duration, slow queries, query counts | PostgreSQL exporter | <100ms average, <1% slow queries |
| Transaction | Transaction rate, rollback rate | PostgreSQL exporter | <0.1% rollback rate |
| Table Statistics | Row count, scan type (index vs. sequential) | PostgreSQL exporter | <10% sequential scans |
| Storage | Table size, index size, bloat | PostgreSQL exporter | <20% bloat |
| TimescaleDB | Chunk creation rate, compression ratio | Custom queries | N/A |

Example PostgreSQL queries used for custom metrics:

```sql
-- Query performance by application
SELECT application_name, count(*), avg(total_exec_time), max(total_exec_time)
FROM pg_stat_statements
GROUP BY application_name;

-- Index usage
SELECT relname, seq_scan, idx_scan,
       (seq_scan::float / (seq_scan + idx_scan + 0.0001)) * 100 AS seq_scan_pct
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE seq_scan + idx_scan > 0;

-- TimescaleDB chunk information
SELECT hypertable_name, chunk_name, chunk_size
FROM timescaledb_information.chunks
ORDER BY hypertable_name, chunk_name;
```

### Business Metrics

Business metrics provide insights into the operational aspects of the Freight Price Movement Agent:

| Metric Category | Key Metrics | Collection Method | Business Value |
|-----------------|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Analysis | Analysis count by type, analysis duration | Custom instrumentation | Usage tracking, performance optimization |
| Data Volume | Records processed, processing rate | Custom instrumentation | Capacity planning, growth tracking |
| Price Change | Average change percentage, significant changes detected | Custom instrumentation | Business insight, anomaly detection |
| User Engagement | Active users, feature usage | Custom instrumentation | Product development, adoption tracking |

These metrics are collected through custom instrumentation in the application code:

```python
# Example Python code for business metrics
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, Gauge

# Analysis metrics
ANALYSIS_COUNT = Counter('analysis_total', 'Total number of analyses performed',
                          ['analysis_type', 'user_type'])
ANALYSIS_DURATION = Histogram('analysis_duration_seconds', 'Analysis execution time',
                               ['analysis_type'])

# Data volume metrics
DATA_RECORDS_PROCESSED = Counter('data_records_processed_total', 
                                  'Total number of data records processed',
                                  ['source', 'record_type'])
DATA_PROCESSING_RATE = Gauge('data_processing_rate', 
                              'Current rate of data processing in records per second')

# Price change metrics
PRICE_CHANGE_PCT = Histogram('price_change_percentage', 
                              'Percentage change in freight prices',
                              ['route_type', 'carrier_type'])
SIGNIFICANT_CHANGES = Counter('significant_price_changes_total',
                               'Number of significant price changes detected',
                               ['route_type', 'carrier_type', 'direction'])
```

### Custom Metrics

In addition to standard metrics, the Freight Price Movement Agent implements custom metrics for specific business needs:

#### 1. Data Quality Metrics

```python
# Data quality metrics
DATA_QUALITY_ISSUES = Counter('data_quality_issues_total', 
                               'Total number of data quality issues detected',
                               ['source', 'issue_type', 'severity'])
DATA_VALIDATION_FAILURES = Counter('data_validation_failures_total',
                                    'Number of data validation failures',
                                    ['validation_rule', 'data_source'])
```

#### 2. Integration Metrics

```python
# Integration metrics
INTEGRATION_REQUESTS = Counter('integration_requests_total',
                                'Number of requests to external systems',
                                ['system', 'endpoint', 'status'])
INTEGRATION_LATENCY = Histogram('integration_request_duration_seconds',
                                 'External system request duration',
                                 ['system', 'endpoint'])
```

#### 3. Analysis Quality Metrics

```python
# Analysis quality metrics
ANALYSIS_ACCURACY = Gauge('analysis_accuracy_percentage',
                           'Estimated accuracy of analysis results',
                           ['analysis_type'])
ANALYSIS_CONFIDENCE = Histogram('analysis_confidence_score',
                                 'Confidence score for analysis results',
                                 ['analysis_type'])
```

### Metric Naming Conventions

All metrics follow a consistent naming convention:

- Use snake_case for metric names
- Include units in the metric name (e.g., `_seconds`, `_bytes`, `_percentage`)
- Use suffixes `_total` for counters and `_count` for event counts
- Include relevant labels for filtering but avoid high cardinality
- Group related metrics with consistent prefixes

## Log Management

### Log Collection

Logs are collected from all components of the Freight Price Movement Agent using a standardized approach:

| Component | Log Output Method | Collection Agent | Destination |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Application Services | JSON to stdout | Filebeat | Elasticsearch |
| Database | PostgreSQL logs | Filebeat | Elasticsearch |
| Infrastructure | System logs | Filebeat | Elasticsearch |
| Containers | Docker logs | Filebeat | Elasticsearch |
| Web Server | Access logs | Filebeat | Elasticsearch |

The log collection process is configured to:

- Collect logs without impacting application performance
- Provide near real-time log availability (within 10 seconds)
- Handle log rotation and clean-up automatically
- Scale with increasing log volumes

### Log Structure

All application logs follow a standardized JSON structure:

```json
{
  "@timestamp": "2023-09-01T12:34:56.789Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "data-ingestion-service",
  "trace_id": "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef",
  "span_id": "abcdef1234567890",
  "message": "Successfully processed batch data",
  "logger": "com.freightpriceagent.ingestion.BatchProcessor",
  "thread": "pool-1-thread-3",
  "context": {
    "batch_id": "b12345",
    "records_count": 1024,
    "processing_time_ms": 342,
    "user_id": "u789"
  },
  "host": {
    "name": "data-ingestion-pod-abc123",
    "ip": "10.0.12.34"
  }
}
```

Key fields include:

- **@timestamp**: ISO 8601 formatted timestamp in UTC
- **level**: Log level (INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG, TRACE)
- **service**: Name of the service that generated the log
- **trace_id/span_id**: Distributed tracing identifiers for correlation
- **message**: Human-readable log message
- **context**: Additional structured data specific to the event
- **host**: Information about the host that generated the log

### Log Levels

The system uses standard log levels with clear guidelines for usage:

| Level | Usage | Examples |
|-------|-------|----------|
| ERROR | System failures, critical issues requiring immediate attention | Database connection failures, service crashes, data corruption |
| WARN | Potential issues, degraded operation | Slow database queries, approaching resource limits, retrying operations |
| INFO | Normal operation events | Service startup/shutdown, job completion, batch processing |
| DEBUG | Detailed information for troubleshooting | Function entry/exit, variable values, configuration details |
| TRACE | Very detailed diagnostics | SQL queries, API request/response payloads, detailed execution steps |

In production environments, ERROR, WARN, and INFO levels are enabled by default. DEBUG and TRACE levels can be enabled temporarily for troubleshooting.

### Log Retention

Log retention policies balance storage costs with operational needs and compliance requirements:

| Log Type | Active Retention | Archive Retention | Storage Type |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Application Logs | 30 days | 90 days | Hot → Warm → Cold |
| System Logs | 14 days | 30 days | Hot → Cold |
| Security Logs | 90 days | 1 year | Hot → Warm → Cold |
| Audit Logs | 1 year | 7 years | Hot → Warm → Cold → Archive |
| Access Logs | 30 days | 90 days | Hot → Cold |

Log lifecycle management is automated using Elasticsearch Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) policies:

```json
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "hot": {
        "min_age": "0ms",
        "actions": {
          "rollover": {
            "max_age": "1d",
            "max_size": "50gb"
          }
        }
      },
      "warm": {
        "min_age": "7d",
        "actions": {
          "shrink": {
            "number_of_shards": 1
          },
          "forcemerge": {
            "max_num_segments": 1
          }
        }
      },
      "cold": {
        "min_age": "30d",
        "actions": {
          "freeze": {}
        }
      },
      "delete": {
        "min_age": "90d",
        "actions": {
          "delete": {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Log Analysis

Logs are analyzed using several techniques:

#### 1. Real-time Log Monitoring

- Kibana dashboards showing live log streams
- Alerts triggered from log patterns (e.g., ERROR occurrences)
- Active monitoring during deployments and critical operations

#### 2. Structured Analysis

- Aggregation by service, endpoint, or error type
- Trend analysis of error rates and warning conditions
- Correlation with metrics and traces

#### 3. Advanced Analytics

- Machine learning for anomaly detection (unusual log patterns)
- Log clustering to identify related issues
- Natural language processing for categorization of issues

Example Kibana query for identifying problematic API endpoints:

```
service: "presentation-service" AND level: "ERROR" AND context.http.method: *
```

## Distributed Tracing

### Tracing Implementation

The Freight Price Movement Agent implements distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry with Jaeger as the backend:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Application Services] -->|Instrument| B[OpenTelemetry SDK]
    B -->|Export| C[Jaeger Collector]
    C -->|Store| D[Jaeger Storage]
    D -->|Query| E[Jaeger UI]
    F[ELK Stack] -.->|Correlate| B
```

Key components of the implementation:

1. **Instrumentation Libraries**:
   - Python: OpenTelemetry Python SDK
   - Java: OpenTelemetry Java SDK
   - JavaScript: OpenTelemetry JS SDK

2. **Context Propagation**:
   - W3C Trace Context headers used for HTTP requests
   - Propagation via message queues for asynchronous processes

3. **Sampling Strategy**:
   - Adaptive sampling with 100% capture for errors
   - Overall 10% sampling rate for normal traffic
   - Priority sampling for critical business flows

4. **Trace Data**:
   - Service name, operation name
   - Timestamps (start, end)
   - Tags/attributes for context
   - Events for specific actions
   - Links to related traces

Example trace for a price analysis request:

```

```

### Trace Sampling

The tracing system uses a multi-level sampling approach to balance visibility with performance:

| Sampling Type | Strategy | Rationale |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| Head-based | Probabilistic (10%) | For everyday traffic |
| Tail-based | 100% for errors/slow requests | Ensure visibility into problems |
| Priority-based | 100% for critical flows | Track important business processes |
| Adaptive | Based on load | Scale down during high traffic |

Sampling configuration is implemented in the OpenTelemetry SDK:

```python
# Example Python sampling configuration
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.sampling import (
    ParentBased,
    TraceIdRatioBased,
    ALWAYS_ON,
    ALWAYS_OFF,
)

# Create composite sampler
sampler = ParentBased(
    # Sample 10% of traces without parent
    root=TraceIdRatioBased(0.1),
    # Always sample if parent is sampled
    remote_parent_sampled=ALWAYS_ON,
    # Don't sample if parent isn't sampled
    remote_parent_not_sampled=ALWAYS_OFF,
)
```

### Trace Analysis

Traces are analyzed to identify performance bottlenecks, errors, and system behavior:

#### 1. Performance Analysis

- Identifying slow components or operations
- Spotting variations in performance across services
- Detecting cascading performance issues

#### 2. Error Analysis

- Tracing request flows that resulted in errors
- Identifying the root cause of failures
- Understanding error propagation across services

#### 3. Dependency Analysis

- Mapping service dependencies
- Identifying critical paths in request processing
- Detecting circular dependencies

Example Jaeger queries for trace analysis:

```
# Find slow API requests
service=api-gateway operation=POST.analysis duration>5s

# Find traces with errors
service=data-ingestion-service error=true

# Find traces for a specific user
tag.user_id=u12345
```

### Correlation with Logs and Metrics

The monitoring system correlates traces with logs and metrics using trace and span IDs:

1. **Log Correlation**:
   - Trace ID and Span ID are included in all log messages
   - Kibana and Jaeger UIs provide links between logs and traces
   - Log context includes operation name and service

2. **Metric Correlation**:
   - Exemplars in Prometheus metrics link to Jaeger traces
   - RED metrics (Request rate, Error rate, Duration) are tracked by service and operation
   - Dashboards combine metrics and trace sampling

Example of a correlated view:

```
Metrics → Detect spike in latency → View trace sample → Identify slow operation → View logs for details → Resolution
```

## Alerting System

### Alert Definition

Alerts are defined using Prometheus Alerting Rules, which specify conditions that trigger notifications when breached:

```yaml
groups:
- name: system_alerts
  rules:
  - alert: HighCPUUsage
    expr: 100 - (avg by (instance) (irate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])) * 100) > 80
    for: 15m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "High CPU usage detected"
      description: "CPU usage is above 80% for more than 15 minutes on {{ $labels.instance }}"
```

Alert definitions follow a standard structure:
- **Name**: Clear, descriptive name
- **Expression**: PromQL query defining the condition
- **Duration**: How long condition must be true before alerting
- **Labels**: Classification metadata (severity, service, etc.)
- **Annotations**: Human-readable information

Common alert categories include:

1. **Resource Alerts**:
   - CPU, memory, disk usage exceeding thresholds
   - Network saturation or errors
   - Connection pool exhaustion

2. **Application Alerts**:
   - High error rates
   - Slow response times
   - Failed health checks
   - Unusual request patterns

3. **Business Alerts**:
   - Data processing delays
   - Analysis failures
   - Integration failures
   - SLA violations

### Alert Severity Levels

Alerts are categorized by severity to determine response urgency:

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| Critical | Service outage or severe degradation affecting users | Immediate (15 min) | Service down, database unavailable |
| Warning | Potential issues requiring attention | 4 hours | High resource usage, elevated error rates |
| Info | Notable events for awareness | 24 hours | New deployment, backup completion |

Each severity level has associated notification channels and escalation procedures.

### Alert Routing

Alerts are routed to appropriate teams based on their classification:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Alert Triggered] --> B{Component Type?}
    
    B -->|Infrastructure| C[Operations Team]
    B -->|Application| D[Development Team]
    B -->|Database| E[Database Team]
    B -->|Integration| F[Integration Team]
    
    C --> G{Severity?}
    D --> G
    E --> G
    F --> G
    
    G -->|Critical| H[Primary On-Call]
    G -->|Warning| I[Team Channel]
    G -->|Info| J[Team Dashboard]
    
    H --> K[Incident Response Process]
```

Alert routing rules in AlertManager:

```yaml
route:
  group_by: ['alertname', 'service']
  group_wait: 30s
  group_interval: 5m
  repeat_interval: 4h
  receiver: 'team-email'
  routes:
  - match:
      severity: critical
    receiver: 'pagerduty'
    continue: true
  - match:
      category: infrastructure
    receiver: 'ops-team'
  - match:
      category: application
    receiver: 'dev-team'
  - match:
      category: database
    receiver: 'db-team'
```

### Notification Channels

Alerts are sent through various channels based on severity and target audience:

| Channel | Use Case | Configuration |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| PagerDuty | Critical alerts requiring immediate action | Integrated via AlertManager |
| Email | Warning and info alerts | SMTP configuration in AlertManager |
| Slack | Team notifications and discussions | Webhook integration to team channels |
| SMS | Backup for critical alerts | Third-party SMS gateway |
| Dashboard | Ambient awareness | Visual indicators on monitoring dashboards |

Example notification configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
- name: 'pagerduty'
  pagerduty_configs:
  - service_key: '<PAGERDUTY_SERVICE_KEY>'
    send_resolved: true

- name: 'team-email'
  email_configs:
  - to: 'team@freightpriceagent.com'
    send_resolved: true

- name: 'slack'
  slack_configs:
  - api_url: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/TXXXXXXXX/BXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX'
    channel: '#monitoring-alerts'
    send_resolved: true
```

### Alert Grouping and Deduplication

Alerts are grouped and deduplicated to prevent alert fatigue:

1. **Grouping**:
   - Related alerts are grouped by service, instance, or alert name
   - Groups are presented together in notifications
   - Updates to group status are batched

2. **Deduplication**:
   - Identical alerts are combined
   - Repeat notifications are suppressed during the repeat interval
   - Resolution notices clear all duplicates

3. **Correlation**:
   - Related alerts are linked to provide context
   - Root cause alerts are highlighted
   - Dependent service alerts are suppressed

Example grouping configuration:

```yaml
route:
  group_by: ['alertname', 'service', 'instance']
  group_wait: 30s      # Wait for related alerts
  group_interval: 5m   # Wait between group updates
  repeat_interval: 4h  # Wait before repeating
```

### Alert Silencing

Alerts can be temporarily silenced during maintenance or known issues:

1. **Silence Creation**:
   - Via AlertManager UI
   - Via API for automated silencing
   - Via ChatOps commands

2. **Silence Scope**:
   - By alert name
   - By service or instance
   - By custom label matcher

3. **Silence Duration**:
   - Explicit end time required
   - Maximum duration policies
   - Extension capabilities

Example silence API request:

```json
{
  "matchers": [
    {
      "name": "service",
      "value": "data-ingestion-service",
      "isRegex": false
    }
  ],
  "startsAt": "2023-09-01T15:00:00Z",
  "endsAt": "2023-09-01T17:00:00Z",
  "createdBy": "john.smith",
  "comment": "Scheduled maintenance"
}
```

## Health Checks

### Liveness Probes

Liveness probes detect if a service is running but deadlocked or otherwise unhealthy:

| Service | Endpoint | Check Type | Success Criteria |
|---------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Data Ingestion | /health/live | HTTP GET | 200 OK response |
| Analysis Engine | /health/live | HTTP GET | 200 OK response |
| Presentation | /health/live | HTTP GET | 200 OK response |
| Integration | /health/live | HTTP GET | 200 OK response |

Implementation details:
- Endpoint returns 200 OK only if the service is functioning correctly
- Checks for deadlocks, excessive memory usage, or other critical issues
- Does not check external dependencies
- Failure triggers container restart

Example liveness check implementation:

```python
@app.route('/health/live', methods=['GET'])
def liveness_check():
    # Check if service is functioning properly
    if app_is_deadlocked():
        return 'Service deadlocked', 500
    
    if memory_usage_critical():
        return 'Memory usage critical', 500
    
    return 'OK', 200
```

### Readiness Probes

Readiness probes verify if a service is ready to handle requests:

| Service | Endpoint | Check Type | Success Criteria |
|---------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Data Ingestion | /health/ready | HTTP GET | 200 OK response |
| Analysis Engine | /health/ready | HTTP GET | 200 OK response |
| Presentation | /health/ready | HTTP GET | 200 OK response |
| Integration | /health/ready | HTTP GET | 200 OK response |

Implementation details:
- Endpoint returns 200 OK only if the service is ready to handle requests
- Checks startup status, configuration, and critical dependencies
- Failure prevents traffic routing to the instance
- Does not trigger restarts

Example readiness check implementation:

```python
@app.route('/health/ready', methods=['GET'])
def readiness_check():
    # Check if service is ready to handle requests
    if not app_initialization_complete():
        return 'Initialization incomplete', 503
    
    if not database_connection_healthy():
        return 'Database connection unhealthy', 503
    
    if not cache_connection_healthy():
        return 'Cache connection unhealthy', 503
    
    return 'OK', 200
```

### Dependency Checks

Dependency checks verify the health of external dependencies:

| Service | Endpoint | Dependencies Checked | Check Frequency |
|---------|----------|----------------------|----------------|
| Data Ingestion | /health/dependencies | Database, Message Queue | 60 seconds |
| Analysis Engine | /health/dependencies | Database, Cache | 60 seconds |
| Presentation | /health/dependencies | Analysis Service, Cache | 60 seconds |
| Integration | /health/dependencies | External APIs, Database | 60 seconds |

Implementation details:
- Performs lightweight checks of critical dependencies
- Returns detailed status of each dependency
- Used for monitoring but not for traffic routing
- Configurable check depth

Example dependency check response:

```json
{
  "status": "degraded",
  "timestamp": "2023-09-01T12:34:56Z",
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "name": "database",
      "status": "healthy",
      "responseTime": 15,
      "details": "Connection pool: 5/20"
    },
    {
      "name": "cache",
      "status": "degraded",
      "responseTime": 120,
      "details": "High latency: 120ms"
    },
    {
      "name": "message-queue",
      "status": "healthy",
      "responseTime": 5,
      "details": "Queue depth: 3"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Deep Health Checks

Deep health checks perform comprehensive system verification:

| Service | Endpoint | Check Type | Check Frequency |
|---------|----------|------------|----------------|
| All Services | /health/deep | HTTP GET | 5 minutes |

Implementation details:
- Performs end-to-end verification of critical functionality
- Executes synthetic transactions to verify system behavior
- Checks data integrity and consistency
- Resource-intensive, run less frequently

Example deep health check implementation:

```python
@app.route('/health/deep', methods=['GET'])
def deep_health_check():
    results = {
        "status": "healthy",
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z",
        "checks": []
    }
    
    # Database connectivity and query check
    db_check = check_database_health()
    results["checks"].append(db_check)
    
    # Cache functionality check
    cache_check = check_cache_health()
    results["checks"].append(cache_check)
    
    # API endpoint check
    api_check = check_api_health()
    results["checks"].append(api_check)
    
    # Synthetic transaction check
    txn_check = run_synthetic_transaction()
    results["checks"].append(txn_check)
    
    # Determine overall status
    if any(check["status"] == "critical" for check in results["checks"]):
        results["status"] = "critical"
    elif any(check["status"] == "degraded" for check in results["checks"]):
        results["status"] = "degraded"
    
    return jsonify(results)
```

## Incident Response

### Incident Classification

Incidents are classified based on severity and impact:

| Severity Level | Description | Impact | Example |
|----------------|-------------|--------|---------|
| P1 - Critical | Service outage or severe degradation | All users affected | System down, data corruption |
| P2 - Major | Significant feature unavailable | Many users affected | Analysis service failure |
| P3 - Minor | Non-critical feature issue | Some users affected | Slow response times |
| P4 - Low | Cosmetic or minor issue | Few users affected | UI display issue |

Impact dimensions considered:
- User impact (how many users affected)
- Business impact (financial or operational)
- Data impact (loss or corruption risk)
- Security impact (potential breach or exposure)

### Escalation Procedures

Escalation follows a structured process to ensure appropriate response:

| Escalation Level | Trigger | Responders | Communication |
|------------------|---------|------------|--------------|
| Level 1 | Initial alert | Primary on-call engineer | Team channel |
| Level 2 | Unresolved after 30 minutes | Team lead + secondary on-call | Incident channel |
| Level 3 | Unresolved after 1 hour | Engineering manager + adjacent teams | Incident bridge |
| Level 4 | Unresolved after 2 hours | Director + stakeholders | Executive notification |

For critical incidents, the escalation timeline is accelerated:
- Level 2 engagement starts immediately
- Level 3 engagement after 15 minutes
- Level 4 engagement after 30 minutes

### Incident Response Workflow

The incident response process follows a standardized workflow:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Alert Triggered] --> B[Initial Assessment]
    B --> C[Incident Declared?]
    
    C -->|No| D[Resolve as Non-Incident]
    C -->|Yes| E[Classify Severity]
    
    E --> F[Assign Incident Commander]
    F --> G[Create Incident Channel]
    G --> H[Begin Investigation]
    
    H --> I[Identify Mitigation]
    I --> J[Apply Mitigation]
    J --> K[Verify Effectiveness]
    
    K -->|Ineffective| I
    K -->|Effective| L[Declare Stable]
    
    L --> M[Communication to Stakeholders]
    M --> N[Begin Recovery]
    N --> O[Post-Incident Review]
    O --> P[Implement Improvements]
```

Key roles in incident response:
- **Incident Commander**: Coordinates response, makes decisions
- **Technical Lead**: Leads investigation and mitigation
- **Communications Lead**: Handles internal/external updates
- **Scribe**: Documents timeline and decisions

### Communication During Incidents

Communication follows established templates and channels:

#### 1. Internal Updates

| Audience | Channel | Frequency | Content |
|----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Response Team | Incident Slack channel | Real-time | Technical details, action items |
| Engineering | Engineering Slack channel | 30 minutes | Status, impact, timeline |
| Management | Email + Management Slack | 1 hour | Business impact, high-level status |

#### 2. External Updates

| Audience | Channel | Frequency | Content |
|----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| End Users | Status page | 1 hour | Service status, ETA |
| Customers | Email (if needed) | Initial + Major updates | Impact, workarounds, ETA |
| Partners | API status endpoint | Automatic | Machine-readable status |

Example status page update:

```
[ONGOING] Analysis Service Degradation - 2023-09-01 14:30 UTC

We are currently experiencing slower than normal response times in the 
Analysis Service. Users may experience delays when creating new analyses.

Our engineering team is actively investigating and working on a resolution.

Affected: Analysis Service
Unaffected: Data Ingestion, Data Export, Reporting

Next update expected by 15:30 UTC.
```

### Post-Mortem Process

After an incident is resolved, a thorough post-mortem analysis is conducted:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Incident Resolved] --> B[Schedule Post-Mortem Meeting]
    B --> C[Collect Data]
    C --> D[Conduct Post-Mortem Meeting]
    D --> E[Document Findings]
    E --> F[Identify Action Items]
    F --> G[Assign Responsibilities]
    G --> H[Track Implementation]
    H --> I[Verify Effectiveness]
```

The post-mortem follows a blameless approach focused on system improvement:

1. **Timeline reconstruction**:
   - Document what happened and when
   - Include all actions taken during response
   - Note decision points and reasoning

2. **Root cause analysis**:
   - Identify the primary cause of the incident
   - Document contributing factors
   - Analyze why existing controls didn't prevent the incident

3. **Impact assessment**:
   - Quantify system downtime
   - Assess data loss, if any
   - Document business impact (e.g., user disruption, financial effects)

4. **Response evaluation**:
   - Evaluate effectiveness of detection mechanisms
   - Analyze response time and efficiency
   - Identify gaps in response procedures

5. **Improvement identification**:
   - Develop specific, actionable improvements
   - Prioritize based on impact and feasibility
   - Assign owners and deadlines

### Improvement Tracking

Improvements identified through post-mortems and operational reviews are tracked to completion:

| Improvement Category | Tracking Method | Review Frequency | Success Criteria |
|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|
| System Reliability | JIRA tickets | Bi-weekly | Reduced incident frequency |
| Detection Capability | Monitoring backlog | Monthly | Reduced MTTD |
| Response Efficiency | Runbook updates | Quarterly | Reduced MTTR |
| Process Improvements | Team OKRs | Quarterly | Measurable process metrics |

Improvement metrics tracked:
- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)**: Time from issue occurrence to detection
- **Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)**: Time from detection to resolution
- **Repeated Incidents**: Count of similar incidents
- **Automated Recovery Rate**: Percentage of issues resolved automatically

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Deployment Verification

Post-deployment monitoring verifies the success of new deployments:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Deployment Completed] --> B[Automated Verification Tests]
    B --> C{Tests Passed?}
    
    C -->|No| D[Automatic Rollback]
    C -->|Yes| E[Smoke Tests]
    
    E --> F{Smoke Tests Passed?}
    F -->|No| D
    F -->|Yes| G[Monitor Key Metrics]
    
    G --> H{Metrics Normal?}
    H -->|No| D
    H -->|Yes| I[Deployment Verified]
    
    D --> J[Notify Team]
    J --> K[Investigate Failure]
    K --> L[Fix Issues]
    L --> M[Redeploy]
```

Key verification steps:

1. **Automated Tests**:
   - Integration tests against the new deployment
   - API contract tests
   - Health check endpoint verification

2. **Smoke Tests**:
   - Critical user paths tested
   - Basic functionality verification
   - Service dependencies checked

3. **Metric Verification**:
   - Error rate monitoring (target: no increase)
   - Response time monitoring (target: no degradation)
   - Resource utilization (target: within expected range)

### Rollback Triggers

Specific metric thresholds trigger automatic or manual rollbacks:

| Metric | Threshold | Action | Observation Period |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Error Rate | >2% (or 2x baseline) | Automatic rollback | 5 minutes |
| P95 Latency | >8s (or 2x baseline) | Alert + Manual decision | 10 minutes |
| Success Rate | <98% | Automatic rollback | 5 minutes |
| CPU Usage | >90% | Alert + Manual decision | 15 minutes |

Rollback decision factors:
- Impact severity
- Business hours vs. off-hours
- Availability of engineering resources
- Fix availability and complexity

### Baseline Comparison

New deployments are compared against pre-deployment baselines:

1. **Baseline Capture**:
   - Key metrics captured before deployment
   - Statistical profiles generated (avg, p50, p95, p99)
   - Normal variation patterns identified

2. **Comparison Methods**:
   - Direct threshold comparison
   - Statistical significance testing
   - Anomaly detection algorithms

3. **Visualization**:
   - Before/after deployment markers on graphs
   - Side-by-side comparison views
   - Automatic diff highlighting

Example baseline comparison query:

```
# Compare error rates before and after deployment
rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5..", service="analysis-service"}[30m]) 
/ 
rate(http_requests_total{service="analysis-service"}[30m])
```

### Gradual Rollout Monitoring

For canary and blue-green deployments, specific monitoring approaches are used:

#### 1. Canary Deployment Monitoring

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start Canary Deployment] --> B[Deploy to 5% of Traffic]
    B --> C[Monitor Key Metrics]
    
    C --> D{Metrics Healthy?}
    D -->|No| E[Rollback Canary]
    D -->|Yes| F[Increase to 20% Traffic]
    
    F --> G[Continue Monitoring]
    G --> H{Still Healthy?}
    H -->|No| E
    H -->|Yes| I[Increase to 50% Traffic]
    
    I --> J[Final Verification]
    J --> K{All Clear?}
    K -->|No| E
    K -->|Yes| L[Complete Rollout]
```

Canary-specific monitoring:
- Direct comparison between canary and stable versions
- Traffic distribution verification
- User cohort analysis
- Feature flag status verification

#### 2. Blue-Green Deployment Monitoring

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Deploy Green Environment] --> B[Verify Green Health]
    B --> C{Green Healthy?}
    
    C -->|No| D[Fix Issues in Green]
    D --> B
    
    C -->|Yes| E[Route Test Traffic to Green]
    E --> F[Monitor Green Performance]
    
    F --> G{Green Performing Well?}
    G -->|No| H[Rollback to Blue]
    G -->|Yes| I[Switch Production to Green]
    
    I --> J[Monitor Closely]
    J --> K{Issues Detected?}
    
    K -->|Yes| L[Immediate Rollback to Blue]
    K -->|No| M[Decommission Blue]
```

Blue-green specific monitoring:
- Environment health comparison
- Deployment state verification
- Traffic routing confirmation
- Database migration verification (if applicable)

## SLA Monitoring

### SLA Metrics

Service Level Agreement (SLA) metrics are continuously monitored to ensure compliance:

| SLA Category | Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Availability | Uptime percentage | 99.9% | Synthetic probes + Health checks |
| Performance | Response time (p95) | <5 seconds | Real user monitoring |
| Reliability | Error rate | <1% | Application metrics |
| Data Freshness | Time since last update | <15 minutes | Data pipeline metrics |

SLA calculation methods:
- **Availability**: `(total_time - downtime) / total_time * 100`
- **Performance Compliance**: `requests_under_threshold / total_requests * 100`
- **Reliability**: `(total_requests - error_requests) / total_requests * 100`
- **Data Freshness**: `current_time - last_successful_update_time`

### SLA Dashboard

A dedicated dashboard provides real-time SLA compliance visibility:

![SLA Dashboard](https://placeholder-for-diagram/sla-dashboard.png)

Key components include:

1. **Current SLA Status**:
   - Gauges showing current compliance
   - Color-coded indicators (green/yellow/red)
   - Time since last violation

2. **Historical Compliance**:
   - Trend graphs showing compliance over time
   - Rolling average compliance
   - Historical violations

3. **SLA Breakdown**:
   - Component-level SLA metrics
   - Critical path analysis
   - Dependency impact

4. **Violation Details**:
   - Recent violation log
   - Root cause categorization
   - Duration and impact metrics

Example SLA dashboard query:

```
# Availability SLA compliance
sum_over_time(up{job="api-gateway"}[30d]) / count_over_time(up{job="api-gateway"}[30d]) * 100
```

### SLA Reporting

Regular SLA reports are generated and distributed to stakeholders:

| Report Type | Frequency | Recipients | Content |
|-------------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Executive Summary | Monthly | Leadership | High-level compliance, trend analysis |

## Capacity Planning

### Resource Utilization Tracking

Resource utilization is continuously tracked to inform capacity planning:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Resource Metrics Collection] --> B[Historical Storage]
    B --> C[Trend Analysis]
    C --> D[Growth Projection]
    D --> E[Capacity Recommendations]
    E --> F[Implementation Planning]
    F --> G[Scaling Implementation]
    G --> A
```

Key metrics tracked for capacity planning:

| Resource | Metrics | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold |
|----------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| CPU | Average utilization, peak utilization | 70% average | 85% average |
| Memory | Usage percentage, GC frequency | 75% usage | 90% usage |
| Disk | Usage percentage, I/O utilization | 70% usage | 85% usage |
| Network | Bandwidth utilization, packet rate | 60% bandwidth | 80% bandwidth |
| Database | Connection count, query volume | 70% connections | 85% connections |
| Cache | Hit rate, eviction rate | <80% hit rate | <70% hit rate |

### Growth Projection

Historical data is used to project future resource needs:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Long-term metrics storage (13 months minimum)
   - Business growth indicators
   - Seasonal patterns

2. **Analysis Methods**:
   - Linear regression for stable growth
   - Seasonal decomposition for cyclical patterns
   - Machine learning for complex patterns

3. **Projection Models**:
   - Resource usage per user/transaction
   - Peak load projections
   - Special event planning

Example growth calculation:

```python
# Simplified growth projection
def project_resource_needs(historical_data, months_ahead, growth_rate=0.1):
    """
    Project future resource needs based on historical data and growth rate.
    
    Args:
        historical_data: DataFrame with timestamp and resource_usage columns
        months_ahead: Number of months to project
        growth_rate: Expected monthly growth rate (0.1 = 10%)
        
    Returns:
        DataFrame with projected resource needs
    """
    # Calculate baseline from recent data
    baseline = historical_data['resource_usage'].tail(30).mean()
    
    # Generate projection
    projection = []
    for month in range(1, months_ahead + 1):
        projected_value = baseline * (1 + growth_rate) ** month
        projection.append({
            'month': month,
            'projected_usage': projected_value,
            'recommended_capacity': projected_value * 1.3  # 30% headroom
        })
        
    return pd.DataFrame(projection)
```

### Capacity Thresholds

Capacity planning is guided by defined thresholds:

| Resource | Planning Threshold | Scaling Increment | Headroom Target |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| CPU | 60% sustained | +2 vCPU | 40% |
| Memory | 65% sustained | +4 GB | 35% |
| Disk | 70% utilization | +100 GB | 30% |
| Database | 60% connections | +25% capacity | 40% |
| Cache | 75% memory usage | +2 GB | 25% |

These thresholds are designed to trigger capacity planning before performance is affected, while the headroom target ensures sufficient capacity for unexpected spikes.

### Scaling Recommendations

Scaling recommendations are generated based on resource utilization and growth projections:

#### 1. Horizontal Scaling Recommendations

| Service | Current Scale | Utilization | Recommendation | Reasoning |
|---------|---------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Data Ingestion | 3 instances | 82% CPU peak | Scale to 5 instances | Near threshold with 15% projected growth |
| Analysis Engine | 5 instances | 65% CPU average | Maintain current scale | Within acceptable range |
| Presentation | 3 instances | 45% CPU average | Maintain current scale | Sufficient headroom |
| Database | db.r5.xlarge | 72% memory | Upgrade to db.r5.2xlarge | Approaching threshold with growth trend |

#### 2. Vertical Scaling Recommendations

For components where horizontal scaling is less effective:

| Component | Current Size | Utilization | Recommendation | Reasoning |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Database CPU | 4 vCPU | 55% peak | Maintain current size | Within acceptable range |
| Database Memory | 16 GB | 78% peak | Upgrade to 32 GB | Near threshold with growth trend |
| Cache Size | 8 GB | 82% peak | Upgrade to 16 GB | Near threshold with growth trend |
| Storage | 500 GB | 65% usage | Maintain with auto-scaling | Growth covered by auto-scaling |

## Monitoring Setup and Maintenance

### Initial Setup

Setting up the monitoring infrastructure involves the following steps:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Docker and Docker Compose installed
   - Network access to container registries
   - Sufficient disk space for monitoring data
   - Required ports available

2. **Installation Process**:
   - Clone the monitoring configuration repository
   - Run the setup script with appropriate parameters
   - Verify component health after installation

```bash
# Example setup command
./monitoring-setup.sh --environment=production --retention=30d
```

The setup script (`monitoring-setup.sh`) automates the entire process, including:
- Creating required directories
- Generating configuration files
- Setting up Docker Compose
- Starting monitoring services
- Initial configuration of dashboards and alerts

Refer to the monitoring setup script documentation for detailed setup options and requirements.

### Configuration Management

Monitoring configuration is managed through version control:

1. **Configuration as Code**:
   - All configurations stored in Git
   - Change review process for configuration updates
   - Automated validation of configuration changes

2. **Configuration Organization**:
   ```
   monitoring/
   ├── prometheus/
   │   ├── prometheus.yml
   │   └── rules/
   │       ├── system_alerts.yml
   │       └── application_alerts.yml
   ├── grafana/
   │   ├── dashboards/
   │   └── datasources/
   ├── alertmanager/
   │   └── alertmanager.yml
   ├── elasticsearch/
   │   └── elasticsearch.yml
   └── docker-compose.yml
   ```

3. **Environment-specific Configuration**:
   - Base configuration templates
   - Environment-specific overlays
   - Secret management integration

### Monitoring the Monitors

The monitoring system itself is monitored to ensure reliability:

1. **Self-monitoring**:
   - Prometheus monitors itself and other monitoring components
   - Dedicated alerts for monitoring infrastructure issues
   - External health checks of monitoring endpoints

2. **Key Health Indicators**:
   - Prometheus metrics storage latency
   - Elasticsearch query performance
   - Grafana response time
   - AlertManager notification delivery

3. **Redundancy**:
   - Secondary monitoring instances
   - Cross-instance monitoring
   - Multi-region monitoring for critical environments

Example Prometheus self-monitoring alert:

```yaml
- alert: PrometheusHighQueryLatency
  expr: prometheus_engine_query_duration_seconds{quantile="0.9"} > 10
  for: 5m
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: "Prometheus query latency is high"
    description: "Prometheus query latency is above 10 seconds for 5 minutes"
```

### Backup and Recovery

Monitoring data and configuration are backed up regularly:

1. **Backup Components**:
   - Prometheus TSDB snapshots
   - Elasticsearch indices
   - Grafana dashboards and datasources
   - Configuration files

2. **Backup Schedule**:
   - Configuration: Daily
   - Prometheus data: Weekly
   - Elasticsearch indices: Daily
   - Grafana dashboards: Daily

3. **Recovery Procedures**:
   - Configuration restoration from Git
   - Data volume restoration from backups
   - Service restart after restoration
   - Verification of monitoring functionality

Example backup script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Backup monitoring components

# Backup directory
BACKUP_DIR="/backups/monitoring/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR

# Backup configuration
cp -r /opt/monitoring/config $BACKUP_DIR/config

# Backup Prometheus data
docker exec prometheus prometheus_container \
  prometheus snapshot save /prometheus/snapshots/backup
cp -r /opt/monitoring/prometheus/snapshots $BACKUP_DIR/prometheus

# Backup Elasticsearch indices
curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/_snapshot/backup_repository/snapshot_$(date +%Y%m%d)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"indices": "filebeat-*", "ignore_unavailable": true}'

# Backup Grafana dashboards
curl -X GET "http://admin:password@localhost:3000/api/dashboards" \
  > $BACKUP_DIR/grafana_dashboards.json

echo "Backup completed to $BACKUP_DIR"
```

### Upgrading Components

Regular updates to monitoring components are necessary for security and features:

1. **Update Process**:
   - Schedule maintenance window
   - Backup current state
   - Update component versions
   - Verify functionality
   - Update documentation

2. **Version Management**:
   - Regular review of component releases
   - Security patch prioritization
   - Compatibility verification
   - Rollback plan development

3. **Testing Updates**:
   - Pre-production validation
   - Canary updates in non-critical environments
   - Functionality verification post-update
   - Performance impact assessment

Example upgrade procedure:

```
1. Notify team of scheduled maintenance
2. Create backup of current configuration and data
3. Update Docker image versions in docker-compose.yml
4. Apply changes with minimal downtime:
   docker-compose pull
   docker-compose up -d
5. Verify all services are running:
   docker-compose ps
6. Validate functionality:
   - Check Prometheus targets
