## Deployment Documentation

### Introduction
This document provides comprehensive guidance for deploying the Freight Price Movement Agent across various environments. It covers deployment strategies, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure provisioning, and operational procedures to ensure a robust, scalable, and reliable deployment.

### Deployment Strategy
The Freight Price Movement Agent supports multiple deployment strategies, each suited for different environments and requirements:

- **Direct Deployment**: Suitable for development environments where rapid iteration is prioritized.
- **Blue/Green Deployment**: Recommended for staging and production environments to minimize downtime during updates.
- **Canary Deployment**: Used for production environments to gradually roll out new features and monitor their impact.

### CI/CD Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline automates the testing and deployment processes, ensuring code quality and rapid delivery. The pipeline consists of the following stages:

1.  **Code Commit**: Developers commit code changes to the source code repository.
2.  **Automated Testing**: The CI system automatically runs unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
3.  **Build and Package**: The application is built and packaged into Docker containers.
4.  **Security Scanning**: Container images are scanned for vulnerabilities.
5.  **Deployment**: The application is deployed to the target environment.
6.  **Post-Deployment Testing**: Automated tests verify the deployment's success.

### Environment Management
The Freight Price Movement Agent supports multiple deployment environments, including development, staging, and production. Each environment has its own configuration and resources.

-   **Development**: Used by developers for local development and testing.
-   **Staging**: Used for integration testing and user acceptance testing.
-   **Production**: The live environment serving end-users.

### Deployment Procedures
The following steps outline the deployment process for each environment:

1.  **Development Environment**:
    a.  Clone the source code repository.
    b.  Configure environment variables.
    c.  Build and run the application using Docker Compose.
2.  **Staging Environment**:
    a.  Merge code changes into the staging branch.
    b.  The CI/CD pipeline automatically builds and deploys the application to the staging environment.
    c.  Run automated tests and user acceptance tests.
3.  **Production Environment**:
    a.  Merge code changes into the production branch.
    b.  The CI/CD pipeline automatically builds and deploys the application to the production environment using a blue/green deployment strategy.
    c.  Monitor the new deployment for any issues.

### Rollback Procedures
In the event of a failed deployment, the following rollback procedures should be followed:

1.  **Identify the Issue**: Determine the cause of the deployment failure.
2.  **Rollback**: Revert to the previous stable version of the application.
3.  **Troubleshoot**: Investigate and resolve the root cause of the failure.
4.  **Redeploy**: Deploy the corrected version of the application.

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
After a successful deployment, it is crucial to monitor the system for any issues. The following metrics should be monitored:

-   CPU utilization
-   Memory usage
-   Disk I/O
-   Network traffic
-   Application response time
-   Error rates

### Infrastructure Provisioning
The Freight Price Movement Agent infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform. Terraform templates are used to create and manage cloud resources, including virtual machines, networks, and storage.

### Operational Procedures
The following operational procedures should be followed to ensure the smooth operation of the Freight Price Movement Agent:

-   Regularly monitor system health and performance.
-   Apply security patches and updates.
-   Perform regular backups.
-   Test the disaster recovery plan.

### Tools and Technologies
The following tools and technologies are used for deployment:

-   GitHub Actions // github/actions:latest
-   Terraform // hashicorp/terraform:1.4.x
-   Docker // docker/docker:latest
-   AWS CLI // aws/aws-cli:2.x
